Recommended use for this software is for servers to be on mobile and for managers and chefs to be on desktop/tablet. The site will function normally for any configuration, but for obvious reasons servers will want to use a small and discreet device such as a mobile touchscreen internet device, while the floor manager and the chef will be in a more stationary position. Adding/editing employees, tables, and menu items is easier to do on desktop as well.
